Sudoku Project ToDo

1) Further refactoring of code. The solver classes are in good shape, but the individual strategies have some repetition, and are a bit hard to parse.
-Big rewrite would be making the cells objects, instead of just attributes of grid object, with blanks as subattributes, and region as attribute
-I started making the blanks a list before realizing the scope of what I was going to do with them...
2) More benchmarking. Currently I'm just benchmarking with my full solver, not bf or lbf because it take a LONG TIME. 
When I get the code in better shape, I'll leave it running for a while. Right now I'd estimate a week to do the full benchmark.
3) Data and Difficulty analysis. Do some data vis and analysis on the benchmark results.
4) Add more statistics into the solvers. Things like amount of backtracking, average contradiction depth.
-Also, a measure of the distribution of the numbers that I brute force. If they're larger on average, will take longer, because my algo starts at 1.
5) Add more strategies. I've programmed the 9 most widely used (to my knowledge), but there are many more that could greatly speed up solving.
6) Generalize to nxn Sudoku. Not too likely any time soon, but would be very interesting.
